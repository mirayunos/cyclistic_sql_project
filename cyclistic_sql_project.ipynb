    "Background:\n",
    "Cyclistic is a bike sharing company that operates 5828 bikes within 692 docking stations. The company has been around since 2016 and separates itself from the competition due to the fact that they offer a variety of bike services including assistive options. Lily Moreno is the director of the marketing team and will be the person to receive these insights from this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Study and business task\n",
    "Lily Morenos perspective on how to generate more income by marketing Cyclistics services correctly includes converting casual riders (one day passes and/or pay per ride customers) into annual riders with a membership. Annual riders are more profitable than casual riders according to the finance analysts. She would rather see a campaign targeting casual riders into annual riders, instead of launching campaigns targeting new costumers. So her strategy as the manager of the marketing team is simply to maximize the amount of annual riders by converting casual riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make a data driven decision, Moreno needs the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A better understanding of how casual riders and annual riders differ\n",
    "* Why would a casual rider become an annual one\n",
    "* How digital media can affect the marketing tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "By merging all 12 monthly bike share data provided, an extensive amount of data with 5,400,000 rows were returned and included in this analysis."
